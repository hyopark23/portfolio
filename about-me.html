      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Reid. Welcome to my portfolio. Right now it is a work in progress but I plan to build a professional looking one in the near future. Currently I am an AP & Payroll Accountant at IOActive, Inc. in downtown Seattle. I've decided to learn web development because I love learning and want to explore career possibilities in coding. You can reach me through my contact information below.</p>
