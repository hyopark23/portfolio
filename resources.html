      <p>Here are some web development learning tools that are super useful.</p>
      <h4>W3School</h4>

          <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="images/w3schools.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Logo of W3Schools"></a>
        <p>W3Schools is a web developer information website, with tutorials and references relating to web development topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and JQuery. The site provides a reference manual covering many aspects of web programming.</p>

          <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"><img src="images/logo-w3c-mobile-lg.png" alt="Logo of W3C Validator" class="img-rounded"></a>
        <p>The Markup Validation Service is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Internet users to check HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed markup. Markup validation is an important step towards ensuring the technical quality of web pages. However, it is not a complete measure of web standards conformance. Though W3C validation is important for browser compatibility and site usability, it has not been confirmed what effect it has on search engine optimization.</p>

          <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/"><img src="images/download.jpeg" alt="Logo of Lorem Ipsum" class="img-circle"></a>
        <p>In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum (derived from Latin dolorem ipsum, translated as "pain itself") is a filler text commonly used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful content with placeholder text allows viewers to focus on graphic aspects such as font, typography, and page layout without being distracted by the content. It also reduces the need for the designer to come up with meaningful text, as they can instead use quickly-generated lorem ipsum.</p>

        <li>
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><img src="images/Git-logo.svg.png" alt="Logo of git"></a>
          <p>Git is a widely used version control system for software development.It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005.</p>
